# UFOs

**Overview of Project:**

The purpose of this analysis was to help Dana with her Javascript file that has a lot of UFO information. We used Javascript’s visual functionality to display the datas and tables since Javascript allows us to manipulate the table by adding filters to allow it to react to user input. We also created an HTML file for easy viewing since we will be posting everything in her article and tables online, which is why she wanted us to put everything in an organized HTML file.

**Results:**

Someone might use this new webpage to filter data that they want to be displayed on the table next to it. They can filter by answering each box or by just answering one of the boxes to filter the data. When they input information in one of the boxes, the letters will change from a gray font to a black font inside the box. If the person only inputs information for one box, then the filtered search would also include a lot of information that they might not want, but would still show everything related to whatever filter they chose.

This webpage also allows them to add more than one filter at a time. For example, someone who visits this webpage can search the date and then everything that doesn’t have that date will be filtered out. They do not have to input information for every box for this to work. Another way they can perform a search would be to put information for more than one box to get a more refined search. An example of that would be to put information for the state like “ca” and also put information for the shape like “circle” at the same time. This would allow them to only get data in the table for California with the shape “circle.”

**Summary:**

One drawback of this webpage is that the user would have to clear whatever they wrote in the boxes individually if they wanted to go back to the default search option. This can be time consuming to the user.

One recommendation I would make for further development would be to make a button to clear all the search filters. If we made a button to clear the search filters, then that would save time for the user to easily search the next thing they want to search. 

Another recommendation I would make for further development would be to make a pop-up for the state so that the user won’t have to remember their state’s abbreviation if they accidentally type the full name of their state. This can help them from getting an error or no search results if they accidentally type the full name of their state.
